								<h3>Mike Colagrosso</h3>
								<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
								<p>As a student, mentee, and friend of Zachery Converse, it is my pleasure to strongly recommend him. I first met
									Zachery years ago at Movement Climbing + Fitness Boulder, and I have worked with him in several capacities, both
									formally and socially. I have put my trust in Zachery, and you should too.</p>
								<p>For this field, my most relevant experience with him might be when I was a student in a short-term class that he
									taught. Like all good classes, it was a mix of lecturing and hands-on instruction. In addition to all the specialized
									technical knowledge he brought to the course, he demonstrated several traits that will serve him in his career:
								</p>
								<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Preparation: Very thorough. I still have my copy of lecture notes that Zachery prepared and refer to them
										regularly.
									</li>
									<li>Communication: Explained a universe of new ideas and their taxonomy. It takes a level of mastery to be able to
										understand students' questions and answer them at the right level.</li>
									<li>Enthusiasm: Bright, friendly. This will be obvious to you once you've known him for 30 seconds. It's immediate
										and infectious.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>In my job as a Staff Software Engineer at Google, I interview many applicants. Among the qualities I evaluate them on
									is "Googliness and Leadership," and Zachery has these qualities in abundance. In his new job, you can expect Zachery
									to value these behaviors in addition to all the technical skill he has mastered:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Community contributions</li>
									<li>Willingness to mentor</li>
									<li>Leaving things better than he found them</li>
								</ul>
								<p>With all that plus his Galvanize/Hack Reactor training, he's the full package. He's someone I'd want sitting next to
									me.</p>
								<p>Sincerely,<br />Mike Colagrosso</p>

								<h3>Evan Schwarz</h3>
								<p>As a member of my team, Zach consistently demonstrated a high degree of initiative and self-direction. Even when faced
								with ambiguous project goals, he proactively sought clarification when necessary, ensuring that time and resources were
								used efficiently. His ability to work independently while understanding when to collaborate was a valuable asset to our
								team.

								Zach was also a perceptive observer of our team's workflow. He frequently offered thoughtful suggestions for process
								improvements that led to increased productivity and a more positive team environment. His open communication style and
								willingness to share insights were highly valued by both colleagues and management.</p>
							</article>
							<article id="meganKellums" style="display:none;">
								<h3>Megan Kellums</h3>
								<p>I was Zachery's supervisor for a few years at Movement Climbing + Fitness. Zachery started as a Front Desk Associate
									and quickly proved how hardworking, dedicated, and enthusiastic he is. He was promoted to Front Desk Lead and then
									Front Desk Director. Zachery is always thinking of ways to improve the systems he works with and shares his ideas
									without hesitation. He is open to feedback and asks direct questions. He also has a great laugh and is always looking
									to connect with others.</p>
							</article>
							<article id="ethanParent" style="display:none;">
								<h3>Ethan Parent</h3>
								<p>Zachery has an unparalleled level of endurance and tenacity that places him in a league of his own. I had the
									opportunity to work with Zachery for a few months. Frequently I would see Zachery working late into the night, working
									tirelessly to learn new concepts that he would then turn around and teach his team mates how to use. It's not an
									exaggeration to say Zachery taught more than a few folks how to configure and deploy proxy servers, even though he had
									no obligation to do so. Zachery's exceptional level of hard work and willingness to help others will make him an
									invaluable asset on any team that is lucky enough to have him</p>
