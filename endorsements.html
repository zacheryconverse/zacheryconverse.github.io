										<h3>Mike Colagrosso</h3>
										<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
										<p>As a student, mentee, and friend of Zachery Converse, it is my pleasure to strongly recommend him. I first met Zachery years ago at Movement Climbing + Fitness Boulder, and I have worked with him in several capacities, both formally and socially. I have put my trust in Zachery, and you should too.</p>
										<p>For this field, my most relevant experience with him might be when I was a student in a short-term class that he taught. Like all good classes, it was a mix of lecturing and hands-on instruction. In addition to all the specialized technical knowledge he brought to the course, he demonstrated several traits that will serve him in his career:
										</p>
										<p>
										<ul>
											<li>Preparation​: Very thorough. I still have my copy of lecture notes that Zachery prepared and refer to them regularly.
											</li>
											<li>Communication:​ Explained a universe of new ideas and their taxonomy. It takes a level of mastery to be able to understand students' questions and answer them at the right level.</li>
											<li>Enthusiasm​: Bright, friendly. This will be obvious to you once you've known him for 30 seconds. It's immediate and infectious.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>In my job as a Staff Software Engineer at Google, I interview many applicants. Among the qualities I evaluate them on is "Googliness and Leadership," and Zachery has these qualities in abundance. In his new job, you can expect Zachery to value these behaviors in addition to all the technical skill he has mastered:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Community contributions</li>
											<li>Willingness to mentor</li>
											<li>Leaving things better than he found them</li>
										</ul>
										<p>With all that plus his Galvanize/Hack Reactor training, he's the full package. He's someone I'd want sitting next to me.</p>
										<p>Sincerely,<br/>Mike Colagrosso</p>
										</p>
										<h3>Ethan Parent</h3>
										<p>Zachery has an unparalleled level of endurance and tenacity that places him in a league of his own. I had the opportunity to work with Zachery for a few months. Frequently I would see Zachery working late into the night, working tirelessly to learn new concepts that he would then turn around and teach his team mates how to use. It's not an exaggeration to say Zachery taught more than a few folks how to configure and deploy proxy servers, even though he had no obligation to do so. Zachery's exceptional level of hard work and willingness to help others will make him an invaluable asset on any team that is lucky enough to have him</p>
										<h3>Megan Kellums</h3>
										<p>I was Zachery's supervisor for a few years at Movement Climbing + Fitness. Zachery started as a Front Desk Associate and quickly proved how hardworking, dedicated, and enthusiastic he is. He was promoted to Front Desk Lead and then Front Desk Director. Zachery is always thinking of ways to improve the systems he works with and shares his ideas without hesitation. He is open to feedback and asks direct questions. He also has a great laugh and is always looking to connect with others.</p>
